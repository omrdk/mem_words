<p>Make your own dictionary in order to memorize them. All you have to do is click on the toolbar button named by <strong>'Dictionay'</strong>. Then you will encounter a file named by <strong>'words.txt'</strong>. So how you will add your words?</p> 
<p>For example:</p> 
Memorize = Ezberlemek

<p>'<u>Memorize</u>' is my english word which I planned to memorize. The word of the '<u>Ezberlemek</u>' is Turkish equivalent of the word 'Memorize'. Like this way add your words but careful: Do not spaces at the end of words!</p> 

<p>That's all.</p>
